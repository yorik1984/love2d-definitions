---@meta love2d

---The primary responsibility for the love.graphics module is the drawing of lines, shapes, text, Images and other Drawable objects onto the screen. Its secondary responsibilities include loading external files (including Images and Fonts) into memory, creating specialized objects (such as ParticleSystems or Canvases) and managing screen geometry.
---
---LÖVE's coordinate system is rooted in the upper-left corner of the screen, which is at location (0, 0). The x axis is horizontal: larger values are further to the right. The y axis is vertical: larger values are further towards the bottom.
---
---In many cases, you draw images or shapes in terms of their upper-left corner.
---
---Many of the functions are used to manipulate the graphics coordinate system, which is essentially the way coordinates are mapped to the display. You can change the position, scale, and even rotation in this way.

--region love.Canvas

---A Canvas is used for off-screen rendering. Think of it as an invisible screen that you can draw to, but that will not be visible until you draw it to the actual visible screen. It is also known as "render to texture".
---
---By drawing things that do not change position often (such as background items) to the Canvas, and then drawing the entire Canvas instead of each item,  you can reduce the number of draw operations performed each frame.
---
---In versions prior to love.graphics.isSupported("canvas") could be used to check for support at runtime.

---Draws a Drawable object (an Image, Canvas, SpriteBatch, ParticleSystem, Mesh, Text object, or Video) on the screen with optional rotation, scaling and shearing.
---
---Objects are drawn relative to their local coordinate system. The origin is by default located at the top left corner of Image and Canvas. All scaling, shearing, and rotation arguments transform the object relative to that point. Also, the position of the origin can be specified on the screen coordinate system.
---
---It's possible to rotate an object about its center by offsetting the origin to the center. Angles must be given in radians for rotation. One can also use a negative scaling factor to flip about its centerline. 
---
---Note that the offsets are applied before rotation, scaling, or shearing; scaling and shearing are applied before rotation.
---
---The right and bottom edges of the object are shifted at an angle defined by the shearing factors.
---
---When using the default shader anything drawn with this function will be tinted according to the currently selected color.  Set it to pure white to preserve the object's original colors.

---* Canvases which use the 'normal' or 'srgb' CanvasFormat will have their content blended in linear RGB and the result will be stored in the canvas in sRGB, when drawing to them. When the Canvas itself is drawn, its pixel colors will be converted from sRGB to linear RGB in the same manner as Images. Keeping the canvas pixel data stored as sRGB allows for better precision (less banding) for darker colors compared to 'rgba8'.
---
---Because most conversions are automatically handled, your own code doesn't need to worry about sRGB and linear RGB color conversions when gamma-correct rendering is enabled, except in a couple cases:
---
---* If a Mesh with custom vertex attributes is used and one of the attributes is meant to be used as a color in a Shader, and the attribute isn't named 'VertexColor'.
---
---* If  a Shader is used which has uniform / extern variables or other variables that are meant to be used as colors, and Shader:sendColor isn't used.
---
---In both cases, love.math.gammaToLinear can be used to convert color values to linear RGB in Lua code, or the gammaCorrectColor (or unGammaCorrectColor if necessary) shader functions can be used inside shader code. Those shader functions ''only'' do conversions if gamma-correct rendering is actually enabled. The LOVE_GAMMA_CORRECT shader preprocessor define will be set if so.

---Options for `love.graphics.newArrayImage`.
---@class love.graphics.newArrayImage.settings
---@field mipmaps boolean True to make the image use mipmaps, false to disable them. Mipmaps will be automatically generated if the image isn't a compressed texture format. (defaults to `false`).
---@field linear? boolean True to treat the image's pixels as linear instead of sRGB, when gamma correct rendering is enabled. Most images are authored as sRGB. (defaults to `false`).
---@field dpiscale? number The DPI scale to use when drawing the array image and calling getWidth/getHeight. (defaults to `1`).

---Creates a new array Image.
---
---An array image / array texture is a single object which contains multiple 'layers' or 'slices' of 2D sub-images. It can be thought of similarly to a texture atlas or sprite sheet, but it doesn't suffer from the same tile / quad bleeding artifacts that texture atlases do – although every sub-image must have the same dimensions.
---
---A specific layer of an array image can be drawn with love.graphics.drawLayer / SpriteBatch:addLayer, or with the Quad variant of love.graphics.draw and Quad:setLayer, or via a custom Shader.
---
---To use an array image in a Shader, it must be declared as a ArrayImage or sampler2DArray type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(ArrayImage image, vec3 texturecoord) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from a slice of the array image. The vec3 argument contains the texture coordinate in the first two components, and the 0-based slice index in the third component.

---Creates an array Image given a different image file for each slice of the resulting array image object.
---
---Illustration of how an array image works: [http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/dec/09/minecraft-like-rendering-experiments-in-opengl-4/illustrations/textures.jpg]
---
---A DPI scale of 2 (double the normal pixel density) will result in the image taking up the same space on-screen as an image with half its pixel dimensions that has a DPI scale of 1. This allows for easily swapping out image assets that take the same space on-screen but have different pixel densities, which makes supporting high-dpi / retina resolution require less code logic.
---
---In order to use an Array Texture or other non-2D texture types as the main texture in a custom void effect() variant must be used in the pixel shader, and MainTex must be declared as an ArrayImage or sampler2DArray like so: uniform ArrayImage MainTex;.
---@param slices table A table containing filepaths to images (or File, FileData, ImageData, or CompressedImageData objects), in an array. Each sub-image must have the same dimensions.

---@field linear? boolean True to treat the image's pixels as linear instead of sRGB, when gamma correct rendering is enabled. Most images are authored as sRGB. (defaults to `false`).

---Creates a new cubemap Image.
---
---Cubemap images have 6 faces (sides) which represent a cube. They can't be rendered directly, they can only be used in Shader code (and sent to the shader via Shader:send).
---
---To use a cubemap image in a Shader, it must be declared as a CubeImage or samplerCube type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(CubeImage image, vec3 direction) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from the cubemap. The vec3 argument is a normalized direction from the center of the cube, rather than explicit texture coordinates.
---
---Each face in a cubemap image must have square dimensions.

---
---Creates a Mesh with custom vertex attributes and the specified vertex data.
---
---The values in each vertex table are in the same order as the vertex attributes in the specified vertex format. If no value is supplied for a specific vertex attribute component, it will be set to a default value of 0 if its data type is 'float', or 1 if its data type is 'byte'.
---
---If the data type of an attribute is 'float', components can be in the range 1 to 4, if the data type is 'byte' it must be 4.
---
---If a custom vertex attribute uses the name 'VertexPosition', 'VertexTexCoord', or 'VertexColor', then the vertex data for that vertex attribute will be used for the standard vertex positions, texture coordinates, or vertex colors respectively, when drawing the Mesh. Otherwise a Vertex Shader is required in order to make use of the vertex attribute when the Mesh is drawn.
---
---A Mesh '''must''' have a 'VertexPosition' attribute in order to be drawn, but it can be attached from a different Mesh via Mesh:attachAttribute.
---
---To use a custom named vertex attribute in a Vertex Shader, it must be declared as an attribute variable of the same name. Variables can be sent from Vertex Shader code to Pixel Shader code by making a varying variable. For example:
---
---''Vertex Shader code''
---
---attribute vec2 CoolVertexAttribute;
---

---@param mode love.MeshDrawMode? How the vertices are used when drawing. The default mode 'fan' is sufficient for simple convex polygons. (defaults to `'fan'`).
---@param usage love.SpriteBatchUsage? The expected usage of the Mesh. The specified usage mode affects the Mesh's memory usage and performance. (defaults to `'dynamic'`).
---@return love.Mesh mesh The new mesh.
---Creates a Mesh with custom vertex attributes and the specified number of vertices.

---Creates a new Quad.
---
---The purpose of a Quad is to use a fraction of an image to draw objects, as opposed to drawing entire image. It is most useful for sprite sheets and atlases: in a sprite atlas, multiple sprites reside in same image, quad is used to draw a specific sprite from that image; in animated sprites with all frames residing in the same image, quad is used to draw specific frame from the animation.

---Creates a new Shader object for hardware-accelerated vertex and pixel effects. A Shader contains either vertex shader code, pixel shader code, or both.
---
---Shaders are small programs which are run on the graphics card when drawing. Vertex shaders are run once for each vertex (for example, an image has 4 vertices - one at each corner. A Mesh might have many more.) Pixel shaders are run once for each pixel on the screen which the drawn object touches. Pixel shader code is executed after all the object's vertices have been processed by the vertex shader.

---@field linear? boolean True to treat the image's pixels as linear instead of sRGB, when gamma correct rendering is enabled. Most images are authored as sRGB. (defaults to `false`).

---Creates a new volume (3D) Image.
---
---Volume images are 3D textures with width, height, and depth. They can't be rendered directly, they can only be used in Shader code (and sent to the shader via Shader:send).
---
---To use a volume image in a Shader, it must be declared as a VolumeImage or sampler3D type (instead of Image or sampler2D). The Texel(VolumeImage image, vec3 texcoords) shader function must be used to get pixel colors from the volume image. The vec3 argument is a normalized texture coordinate with the z component representing the depth to sample at (ranging from 1).
---
---Volume images are typically used as lookup tables in shaders for color grading, for example, because sampling using a texture coordinate that is partway in between two pixels can interpolate across all 3 dimensions in the volume image, resulting in a smooth gradient even when a small-sized volume image is used as the lookup table.
---
---Array images are a much better choice than volume images for storing multiple different sprites in a single array image for directly drawing them.

---Draws formatted text, with word wrap and alignment.
---
---See additional notes in love.graphics.print.
---
---The word wrap limit is applied before any scaling, rotation, and other coordinate transformations. Therefore the amount of text per line stays constant given the same wrap limit, even if the scale arguments change.
---
---In version 0.9.2 and earlier, wrapping was implemented by breaking up words by spaces and putting them back together to make sure things fit nicely within the limit provided. However, due to the way this is done, extra spaces between words would end up missing when printed on the screen, and some lines could overflow past the provided wrap limit. In version 0.10.0 and newer this is no longer the case.
---
---In versions prior to 11.0, color and byte component values were within the range of 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 1.

---Rotates the coordinate system in two dimensions.
---
---Calling this function affects all future drawing operations by rotating the coordinate system around the origin by the given amount of radians. This change lasts until love.draw() exits.

---
---@param angle number The amount to rotate the coordinate system in radians.
function love.graphics.rotate(angle) end

---Scales the coordinate system in two dimensions.
---
---By default the coordinate system in LÖVE corresponds to the display pixels in horizontal and vertical directions one-to-one, and the x-axis increases towards the right while the y-axis increases downwards. Scaling the coordinate system changes this relation.
---
---After scaling by sx and sy, all coordinates are treated as if they were multiplied by sx and sy. Every result of a drawing operation is also correspondingly scaled, so scaling by (2, 2) for example would mean making everything twice as large in both x- and y-directions. Scaling by a negative value flips the coordinate system in the corresponding direction, which also means everything will be drawn flipped or upside down, or both. Scaling by zero is not a useful operation.
---
---Scale and translate are not commutative operations, therefore, calling them in different orders will change the outcome.
