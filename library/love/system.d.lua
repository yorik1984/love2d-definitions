---@alias love.PowerState
---| '"unknown"' # Cannot determine power status.
---| '"battery"' # Not plugged in, running on a battery.

---Gets text from the clipboard.

---
---@return string text The text currently held in the system's clipboard.
function love.system.getClipboardText() end

---Gets the current operating system. In general, LÖVE abstracts away the need to know the current operating system, but there are a few cases where it can be useful (especially in combination with os.execute.)
---
---[Open in Browser](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.system.getOS)
---
---In LÖVE version 0.8.0, the '''love._os''' string contains the current operating system.
---@return string osString The current operating system. 'OS X', 'Windows', 'Linux', 'Android' or 'iOS'.
function love.system.getOS() end

---Gets information about the system's power supply.
---
---[Open in Browser](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.system.getPowerInfo)
---
---@return love.PowerState state The basic state of the power supply.
---@return number percent Percentage of battery life left, between 0 and 100. nil if the value can't be determined or there's no battery.
---@return number seconds Seconds of battery life left. nil if the value can't be determined or there's no battery.
function love.system.getPowerInfo() end

---Gets the amount of logical processor in the system.
---
---[Open in Browser](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.system.getProcessorCount)
---
---The number includes the threads reported if technologies such as Intel's Hyper-threading are enabled. For example, on a 4-core CPU with Hyper-threading, this function will return 8.
---@return number processorCount Amount of logical processors.
function love.system.getProcessorCount() end

---Gets whether another application on the system is playing music in the background.
---
---Currently this is implemented on iOS and Android, and will always return false on other operating systems. The t.audio.mixwithsystem flag in love.conf can be used to configure whether background audio / music from other apps should play while LÖVE is open.
---
---[Open in Browser](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.system.hasBackgroundMusic)
---
---@return boolean backgroundmusic True if the user is playing music in the background via another app, false otherwise.
function love.system.hasBackgroundMusic() end

---Opens a URL with the user's web or file browser.
---
---[Open in Browser](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.system.openURL)
---
---Passing file:// scheme in Android 7.0 (Nougat) and later always result in failure. Prior to 11.2, this will crash LÖVE instead of returning false.
---@param url string The URL to open. Must be formatted as a proper URL.
---@return boolean success Whether the URL was opened successfully.
function love.system.openURL(url) end

---Puts text in the clipboard.
---
---[Open in Browser](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.system.setClipboardText)
---
---@param text string The new text to hold in the system's clipboard.
function love.system.setClipboardText(text) end

---Causes the device to vibrate, if possible. Currently this will only work on Android and iOS devices that have a built-in vibration motor.
---
---[Open in Browser](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.system.vibrate)
---
---@param seconds number The duration to vibrate for. If called on an iOS device, it will always vibrate for 0.5 seconds due to limitations in the iOS system APIs. (defaults to `0.5`).
function love.system.vibrate(seconds) end
